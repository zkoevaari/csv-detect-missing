TODO
====

* FILE argument '-' should mean to read the argument/content from STDIN (file descriptor 0)
* Timestamp format when not UTC?
* Quoted fields?
* Gap resolution: should be dependent of time-base used (and clarify in help)
* Should be able to use time-base gap format for unix timestamps
* 'Equals' comparison with --eq
* Diff mode should also output the calculated gap, in seconds or other format
* Header in diff mode and quiet flag with -q to turn it off
* Output format option
