====

* Ellipsize field in error messages
* FILE argument '-' should mean to read the argument/content from STDIN (file descriptor 0)
* Timestamp format when not UTC? What if differing?
* Quoted fields?
* Gap resolution: should be dependent of time-base used (and clarify in help)
* Should be able to use time-base gap format for unix timestamps
* 'Equals' comparison with --eq, also --ne
* Diff mode should also output the calculated gap (in seconds or other format), and possibly the line number
* Header in diff mode and quiet flag with -q to turn it off
* Output format option (for timestamps)
* Multiple comparison options, or some way to chain?
